Usage: )*" + d_progname + R"*( <INPUT> [<PASSPHRASE>] [OPTIONS]

<INPUT> must be either a regular file, a backup file as exported by the Signal Android app, or a
directory containing an unpacked backup as created by this program. In case the input <INPUT> is
a regular file, a <PASSPHRASE> is required. If it is omitted from the command line, a prompt is
presented during runtime.
Be sure to read the README at https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/ for more detailed
instructions for the core functions and examples.
Note: this program never modifies the input, if you wish to alter the backup in any way and save your
changes, you must provide one of the output options.

 = COMMON OPTIONS =
-i, --input <INPUT>            If for whatever reason you do not wish to pass the input as the first
                               argument, you can use this option anywhere in the list of arguments
-p, --passphrase <PASSPHRASE>  If for whatever reason you do not wish to pass the input as the second
                               argument, you can use this option anywhere in the list of arguments. If
                               this option is omitted, but <INPUT> is a regular file, a prompt is
                               presented to enter the passphrase at runtime (also see `--interactive').
--no-showprogress              Do not output the progress percentage. Especially useful when redirecting
                               output to file.
-h, --help                     Show this help message
-l, --logfile <LOG>            Write programs output to file <LOG>. If the output file exists, it will
                               be overwritten without warning.
--interactive                  Prompt for all passphrases
--runsqlquery <QUERY>          Run <QUERY> against the backup's internal SQL database.
--runprettysqlquery <QUERY>    As above, but try show output in a pretty table. If the output is not too
                               large for your terminal, this is often much more readable.
--no-truncate                  By default, `--runprettysqlquery' truncates table columns to fit the
                               terminal. With this option, this can be disabled, useful when redirecting
                               output to file (or using the `--logfile' option.
--listthreads                  List the threads in the database with their `_id' numbers. These id's are
                               required input for various other options.
--listrecipients               List all recipients in the database with their `_id'. These id's are
                               required input for various other options.
--setselfid <PHONENUMBER>      Various options need to know which recipient in the backup is 'self': the
                               originator of the backup. These functions generally scan the backup to
                               automatically determine the correct recipient. If this fails, this option
                               can be used to set the <PHONENUMBER> of the backups owner, in the format
                               it appears in the database, usually `+12345678901'.

 = OUTPUT OPTIONS =
-o, --output <OUTPUT>                    Either a file or a directory. When output is a file, this will
                                         be a normal backup file, compatible with the Signal Android app.
                                         When output is a directory, the backup's separate parts (frames,
                                         SQL database and media) are written to that directory
                                         unencrypted. This directory can later be used as <INPUT> to
                                         create a working backup file.
-op, --opassphrase <PASSPHRASE>          When output is a file, this will be the backups passphrase. May
                                         be omitted (in which case the <INPUT> passphrase is used.
   --onlydb                              Optional modifier for `--output', when <OUTPUT> is a directory.
                                         This causes only the SQLite database to be written to disk.
--dumpmedia <DIRECTORY>                  Save all media attachments to DIRECTORY. An attempt is made to
                                         give each attachment a correct name and timestamp as well as to
                                         place the attachments in sub-folders for each conversation.
   --limittothreads <THREADS_LIST>       Optional modifier for `--dumpmedia'. Only save the attachments
                                         from the listed threads. List format same as `--croptothreads'
   --limittothreadsbyname <THREADS_LIST> Optional modifier for `--dumpmedia'. Only save the attachments
                                         from the listed threads. List format same as
                                         `--croptothreadsbyname'
   --limittodates <LIST_OF_DATES>        Optional modifier for `--dumpmedia'. Only export messages within
                                         the ranges defined by LIST_OF_DATES. List format is the same as
                                         `--croptodates'.
   --excludestickers                     Optional modifier for `--dumpmedia'. Exclude stickers from the
                                         media dump.
--dumpavatars <DIRECTORY>                Save all avatars to DIRECTORY.
   --limitcontacts <CONTACTS>            Optional modifier for `--dumpavatars'. Only the avatars of
                                         listed contacts are saved. CONTACTS is a list "Name 1,Name
                                         2(,...)", where each name is exactly as it appears in Signal's
                                         conversation overview or from this program's `--listrecipients'
                                         output.
--exportxml <FILE>                       Export the messages from the internal sms table to XML file FILE.)*"
//   --includemms
//   --includeattachmentdata
//   --setselfid
R"*(
--exporthtml <DIRECTORY>                 Export the messages to HTML files. Each conversation will be
                                         placed in a separate subdirectory.
   --limittothreads <THREADS_LIST>       Optional modifier for `--exporthtml'. Only export the listed
                                         threads. List format same as `--croptothreads'
   --limittothreadsbyname <THREADS_LIST> Optional modifier for `--exporthtml'. Only save the attachments
                                         from the listed threads. List format same as
                                         `--croptothreadsbyname'

                                         the ranges defined by LIST_OF_DATES. List format is the same as
                                         `--croptodates'.
   --migratedb                           Optional modifier for `--exporthtml'. Some older databases require
                                         this option to (attempt) to update the database format to a newer
                                         supported format. The program will tell you when you need to add
                                         this option.
   --append                              Optional modifier for `--exporthtml'. Causes `--exporthtml' to
                                         not show an error when DIRECTORY is not empty, but also not
                                         overwrite existing media files. Still regenerates and overwrites
                                         existing HTML files.
   --split [N]                           Optional modifier for `--exporthtml'. Splits the generated HTML
                                         files to a maximum of N messages per page. By default, the pages
                                         are not split. When this option is given without a value for N,
                                         N is 1000. Can not be combined with `--split-by`.
   --split-by [PERIOD]                   Optional modifier for `--exporthtml'. Splits the generated HTML
                                         files by calendar PERIOD. Supported values for PERIOD are 'year',
                                         'month', 'week', and 'day'. Can not be combined with `--split`.
   --light                               By default a dark theme is used for the rendered HTML. Add this
                                         option to output in a light theme instead.
   --includereceipts                     Optional modifier for `--exporthtml'. Adds available info from
                                         message receipts to the HTML page. Note, this potentionally slows
                                         down page loading for large conversations significantly.
   --originalfilenames                   Optional modifier for `--exporthtml'. Use the original filenames
                                         for attached media when available. This option can not be used
                                         together with `--append'.
   --compactfilenames                    Use (very) short filenames for the generated HTML pages. May be
                                         of use when running into maximum path length limitations on
                                         Windows.
   --htmlignoremediatypes [MIME_LIST]    Treat message attachments with mimetype in `MIME_LIST' as
                                         non-media attachment. Useful for types not commonly supported by
                                         browsers, such as `video/3gpp'.
   --allhtmlpages                        Optional modifier for `--exporthtml'. Convenience option that
                                         enables all the modifying options for `--exporthtml' listed below.
   --themeswitching                      Optional modifier for `--exporthtml'. Adds a button to the HTML
                                         to switch the theme between light and dark. This adds a bit of
                                         JavaScript to the page, and sets a cookie when switching.
   --searchpage                          Optional modifier for `--exporthtml'. Generates a page from where
                                         conversations can be searched. This adds JavaScript to the page.
                                         Also, a search index is generated to facilitate searching.
   --includecalllog                      Optional modifier for `--exporthtml'. Generate a call log-page.
   --stickerpacks                        Optional modifier for `--exporthtml'. Generate an overview of
                                         installed and known stickerpacks.
   --includeblockedlist                  Optional modifier for `--exporthtml'. Generate an overview of
                                         blocked contacts in the database.
   --includesettings                     Optional modifier for `--exporthtml'. Generate a page showing
                                         settings found in the backup file.
   --includefullcontactlist              Optional modifier for `--exporthtml'. Generate a page showing all
                                         contacts present in the backups database. These include hidden
                                         and blocked contacts, but also system contacts who might not use
                                         Signal at all.
   --addexportdetails                    Optional modifier for `--exporthtml'. Adds some metadata about this
                                         tools and the backup to the pages when printing.
   --linkify                             Optional modifier for `--exporthtml'. Attempts to turn URLs in
                                         messages actual clickable links. This option is enabled by deault,
                                         and can be disabled by `--no-linkify'.
   --chatfolders                         Optional modifier for `--exporthtml'. Exports chat folders. This
                                         option may interact poorly with the `--limitto[xxx]' options.
--exporttxt <DIRECTORY>                  Export the messages to plain text file. Attachments are omitted.
                                         This option also supports the `--limittothreads',
                                         `--limittothreadbybame', `--limittodates', and `--migratedb'
                                         modifiers as mentioned above.
--exportcsv <MAP_OF_FILES>               Export the database to file of comma separated values. Argument:
                                         "tablename1=filename1,tablename2=filename2(,...)"
--overwrite                              Optional modifier for all output operations. Overwrite output
                                         files if they exist. When <OUTPUT> is a directory this will
                                         delete ALL directory contents.

 = EDITING OPTIONS =
--croptothreads <THREADS_LIST>           Crop database to list of threads. The list supports comma
                                         separated numbers or ranges (for example: "1,3,4-8,13") or the
                                         special keyword `ALL'. Threads are specified by their id (see:

--importthreads <LIST_OF_THREADS>        Import LIST_OF_THREADS into <INPUT> database, the list format is
                                         the same as `--croptothreads'. This operation requires the
                                         `--source' option to be passed as well.
   -s, --source <SOURCE>                 Required modifier for `--importthreads'. The source backup from
                                         which to import threads (see `--importthreads'). The input can be
                                         a file or directory. When it is a file, a passphrase is required
   -sp, --sourcepassphrase <PASSPHRASE>  The 30 digit passphrase for the backup file specified by `--source'.
--importfromdesktop                      Import messages from Signal Desktop. If the program fails to find
                                         your Signal-Desktop installation or it is in a non-standard location,
                                         the optional [DIR1] and [DIR2] can be provided. See the README for
                                         more information.
--dumpdesktopdb <OUTPUT>                 Decrypt the Signal Desktop database and saves it to <OUTPUT>.
   --desktopdir <DIR>                    Optional modifier for `--importfromdesktop` and `--dumpdesktopdb`.
                                         If the program fails to find your Signal-Desktop installation or it
                                         is in a non-standard location <DIR> can be provided. See the README
                                         for more information about default locations.
   --ignorewal                           Optional modifier for `--importfromdesktop' and `--dumpdesktopdb`.
                                         Ignores an existing WAL file when opening Signal Desktop database.
   --limittodates <LIST_OF_DATES>        Optional modifier for `--importfromdesktop'. Limit the messages
                                         imported to the specified date ranges. The format of the list of

                                         `--replaceattachments'. Only deal with attachments within these
                                         threads. For list format see `--croptothreads'.
   --onlyolderthan <DATE>                Optional modifier for `--deleteattachments' and
                                         `--replaceattachments'. Only deal with attachments for messages

The following options are also supported in this program, and listed here for completeness. Some of them
are mostly useful for the developer, others were custom functions for specific problems that are not
expected to be very useful to other people. Most of these functions are poorly tested (if at all) and
possibly outdated. Some will probably eventually be renamed and more thoroughly documented others will
be removed.
--showdbinfo                                  Prints a list of all tables and columns in the backups

--scramble                                    Poorly censors backups, replacing all characters with 'x'.

--mergerecipients <OLDNUMBER,NEWNUMBER>       Can be used to change a contacts number (for example when
                                              they get a new phone). Messages from OLDNUMBER are changed
                                              so they appear as coming from NEWNUMBER, and the threads
                                              are merged.
--migrate214to215                             Migrate a v214 database to v215. Changes in the database
