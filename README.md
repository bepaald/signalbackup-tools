### Important Note

Signal is an actively developed application and consequently, the database format changes regularly. Often the changes do not affect the backup file format or the working of this program, but every once in a while a change does break (some of) the functionality of this program. It has happened before and it will happen again. Sometimes I fix it within hours, but when I am short on time, it may take a little longer. Any breakage will be dealt with as soon as I have some spare time.

### Requirements

To compile this project, current stable released versions of the following are needed:
- a c++ compiler supporting at least the c++17 standard (tested with [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org) 13.1.1 and [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org) 15.0.7, also tested and working with a few older compiler versions)
- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) (tested with 3.1.1, but should also work with 1.1 versions).
- [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/) (tested with 3.42.0)

### Obtaining

**<span id="compiling">Compiling</span>**

To compile the program, just running `g++ -std=c++20 */*.cc *.cc -lcrypto -lsqlite3` should generally do the trick. Add any compiler flags you feel useful, I personally use at least `-O3 -Wall -Wextra`. When compiling with an old compiler version (gcc 8.x or clang <= 7), also add the `-lstdc++fs` flag and replace `-std=c++20` with `-std=c++17`.

If you have `cmake` available on your system, running `cmake -B build && cmake --build build -j` inside the project directory should also produce a working binary (found in the directory 'build') and make use of multiple processors if available. 

For people not comfortable compiling source code, a script is provided that should compile the binary on Arch and Fedora (and probably many other distributions). Assuming the needed [requirements](#requirements) are installed, a simple `sh BUILDSCRIPT` should build the program (or, when using bash on a multiprocessor system, use `bash BUILDSCRIPT_MULTI.bash44` for a faster build, and let me know if it works).

For Arch users, an AUR package [is available](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/signalbackup-tools-git).

The program is also available in `nixpkgs` as [`signalbackup-tools`](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&type=packages&query=signalbackup-tools) and can be installed on any system that supports the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/).

Alternatively, a Dockerfile has been kindly provided by David J. Meier, and is available at his gitlab page: <https://gitlab.com/splatops/cntn-signalbackup-tools>.

**<span id="macos">macOs</span>**

A homebrew formula is provided in at [homebrew/signalbackup-tools.rb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/master/homebrew/signalbackup-tools.rb). On modern macOs versions, with [homebrew set up](https://brew.sh/), compiling should be as simple as running `brew install --HEAD [path/to/signalbackup-tools.rb]`. Once installed, the program can be upgraded by running `brew upgrade --fetch-HEAD`.

Manually compiling should also be possible assuming the dependencies are installed, for more info see [here](https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/issues/9), or more recently [here](https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/issues/85). macOs users might also consider the aforementioned [Nix package](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&type=packages&query=signalbackup-tools).

**<span id="windows">Windows binary</span>**

For the most recent Windows executable, check [the releases page](https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/releases). This executable is a static build, cross compiled from my Arch Linux system. It is only minimally tested, but generally appears to work just fine.

Note for Windows users: this is a command line application. This means you can not just double-click the executable to run it, you need to run it from a terminal. Common terminals for Windows are `cmd` (Command Prompt) and `PowerShell`. An example of running the program on Windows 10 can be seen [here](https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/issues/148#issuecomment-1732375861).

### Running

_NOTE: In all examples below, one or more passphrases are provided on the command line. If so desired, these can be omitted in which case you are prompted for the passphrase at runtime._

**<span id="fix">Fixing broken backups</span>**

Around version 6.26 of Signal Android, the backup format was changed in a way that makes it impossible to recover from data corruption that happens across fame boundaries. This functionality is disabled for newer backups. In other cases (corruption within a single frame, the occasional bug in Signal), part of the data could possibly still be recovered, though it might require a custom function. You could always open an issue if you need help.

At the moment it has been used successfully to fix backups that were corrupted for some reason (see https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/issues/8355, and https://community.signalusers.org/t/tool-to-re-encrypt-signal-backup-optionally-changing-password-or-dropping-bad-frames/6497). If you want to fix a broken backup, run the tool as follows:

```
signalbackups-tools [input] [passphrase] --output [outputfile] (--opassphrase [newpassphrase])
```

_NOTE: if the corruption happens outside of attachment data, which is usually unlikely, chances of recovery are much lower._

If the output passphrase is omitted, the input passphrase is used to encrypt the new backup file. If the 'input' is a directory, it is assumed to contain a decrypted dump of the backup (as made by this tool) and the input passphrase can be omitted. In this case the output passphrase is required, unless 'output' is also a directory.

If the 'output' is omitted only the scan is done, and the broken message is identified, giving you the option to delete it from the phone. The corrupted attachment data is dumped to file.

**<span id="dump">Dump decrypted database to disk</span>**

The program can also dump the decrypted backup components to a directory, or read the contents of a directory and pack and encrypt it back into a valid backup file. When dumping, make sure the directory to dump to is empty to start with. In theory, the decrypted files could be edited before re-encrypting. The tool can be called the same as above, except the output should be a directory:


```
signalbackups-tools [input] [passphrase] --output [outputdirectory]
```

To skip exporting media (like message attachments, avatars and stickers), add the option `--onlydb`.

**<span id="dumpmedia">Dump media to disk</span>**

To only export all media (like message attachments and avatars) from a backup, run as follows:

```
signalbackups-tools [input] [passphrase] --dumpmedia [outputdirectory]
```

Where `outputdirectory` is an existing directory.


**<span id="export">Export HTML, TXT, CSV & XML</span>**

##### Export to HTML

_NOTE: Note that while the the generated HTML is heavily inspired by Signal's look it does not aim to be a perfect reproduction of it. The generated HTML and CSS are only tested on Firefox (but both pass W3C validation). It is possible that some (very) old backups are not supported. If there is demand, support for older databases may be added in the future._

To export your messages to HTML, use `--exporthtml [DIRECTORY]`. To limit the output to certain threads the option `--limittothreads [LIST_OF_THREADS]` can be added. The list of threads can contain both ranges and comma separated values, e.g. `--limittothreads 1,2,3,8-16,20`. The thread numbers can be obtained from `--listthreads`. Additionally, threads can be identified by name: `--limittothreadsbyname "Alice","Bob","Family Group"`. Similarly, the option `--limittodates [LIST_OF_DATES]` will limit the output to messages within the time periods listed. For the format of the date list, see the [crop to dates](#crop) option. Because writing out all media files can be a long process, the option `--append` can be added to reuse any existing media files, only new media and the HTML-files wil be rewritten. Example:

```
./signalbackup-tools [input] [passphrase] --exporthtml [directory]
```

Because browsers may have difficulty loading an entire conversation if it consists of a large number of messages, the option `--split [N]` can be added to split the output HTML in multiple pages. The optional number `N` is the maximum number of messages on each generated page (default: 1000).

By default, the function will create a HTML page resembling Signal's dark mode. If you prefer a light theme, add the `--light` option. If you want to be able to switch between the two modes without generating a new HTML page, you could add the `--themeswitching` option to the command. This will add a button to switch themes. Be aware this causes the page to use javascript and cookies.

A call-log page can be generated by adding the `--includecalllog` option.

A big thanks to [Gertjan van der Burg](https://github.com/GjjvdBurg)! While HTML export was always a planned feature of this program, it would not have happened this quickly without his project [signal2html](https://github.com/GjjvdBurg/signal2html). The HTML this function generates is modified from the template from his original project.

##### Export to TXT

To export to plain text use `--exporttxt [DIRECTORY]`. Some data is omitted from this export, such as attachment data and quotes. To limit the output to certain threads the option `--limittothreads [LIST_OF_THREADS]` can be added. The list of threads can contain both ranges and comma separated values, e.g. `--limittothreads 1,2,3,8-16,20`. The thread numbers can be obtained from `--listthreads`. Additionally, threads can be specified with `--limittothreadsbyname "Alice","Bob","Group Name"`. Similarly, the option `--limittodates [LIST_OF_DATES]` will limit the output to messages within the time periods listed. For the format of the date list, see the [crop to dates](#crop) option. Example:

```
./signalbackup-tools [input] [passphrase] --exporttxt [directory]
```

The output will look something like this:

```
[2023-07-10 01:23] <alice> Where are you?
[2023-07-10 01:25] <bob> I'm at the beach.
[2023-07-10 01:26] *** <bob> sent "Signal-1.jpeg"
[2023-07-10 01:27] <alice> Come home. You haven't washed the dishes. (Bob: 😮)
```

##### Export to CSV

To export the tables to a file of comma separated values (CSV), use `--exportcsv [table1]=[filename1],[table2]=[filename2],...`. To get all messages from the database, only the 'message' table needs to be exported. To get all messages out of older databases, the 'sms' and 'mms' tables need to be exported.

##### Export to XML

To export to XML file, use `--exportxml [filename]`. _NOTE: Currently this will only export the messages from the `sms` table, NOT the `mms` table. This should be exactly the same data the official Signal app used to output when exporting a plaintext backup. All messages with an attachment, as well as all outgoing group messages are in the `mms` database, and thus are skipped. Exporting the `mms` table is being worked on. This option should be considered experimental._ _**NOTE** As of Signal's current version, the messages in the `sms` table have been moved to the `mms` table and the `sms` table has been dropped from the database. This has rendered this function practically useless for the time being, since it only dealt with the `sms` table. While code to export the `mms` table was quite far along, it may now need more work which may take a while._


**<span id="crop">Cropping to certain conversations or dates</span>**

_NOTE: This feature is experimental (even more so than the others). I test it fairly well myself, but I have no knowledge of it being used by other people. If you use it, please let me know if it works for you._

##### Crop to threads

To crop a backup file to certain threads, run:

```
signalbackup-tools [input] [passphrase] --croptothreads [list-of-threads] --output [output] (--passphrase [newpassphrase])
```

Where the list of threads are the ids as reported by `signalbackup-tools [input] [passphrase] --listthreads`. The list supports commas for single ids and hyphens for ranges, for example: `--croptothreads 1,2,5-8,10`. Additionally, threads can be specified by name: `--croptothreadsbyname "Alice","Bob","Some Group"`.

##### Crop to dates

To crop a backup file to certain dates, run:

```
signalbackup-tools [input] [passphrase] --croptodates begindate1,enddate2(,begindate2,enddate2(,...)) --output [output] (--opassphrase [newpassphrase])
```

The 'begindate' and 'enddate' must always appear in pairs and can be either in "YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss" format or as a single number of [milliseconds since epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). For example, the following commands are equivalent (in my time zone) and both crop the database to the messages between Sept. 18 2019 and Sept 18 2020: `--croptodates "2019-09-18 00:00:00","2020-09-18 00:00:00"` or `--croptodates 1568761200000,1600383600000`.

**<span id="merge">Merging backups</span>**

_NOTE: Although this feature generally seems to work quite well, it requires constant maintenance to keep up with changes in Signal's internal database. You may encounter problems if this program happens to be slightly out of date when you run it. As always, feel free to open an issue to notify me of problems._

To merge two backups, the backups must be at compatible database versions. The database version can be found by running `signalbackup-tools [input] [passphrase] --listthreads`. Though many database versions work perfectly fine together, sometimes breaking changes are made. For example two databases at versions before and after 168 can not be merged successfully. Before opening an issue, if needed, import the backups into Signal and export them again to get them updated and at equal versions. To import all threads from one database into another, run:

```
signalbackup-tools [first_database] [passphrase] --importthreads ALL --source [second_database] --sourcepassphrase [passphrase] --output [output_file] (--opassphrase [output passphrase])
```

It is recommended to use the larger (containing the most data (contacts, threads,...)) as the 'first_database' and the smaller one source. If not all threads should be imported from the source, a list of thread ids can be supplied (e.g. `--importthreads 1,2,3,8-16,20`). The thread ids can be determined from the output of `--listthreads`. Threads can additionally be specified by name using `--importthreadsbyname "Bob","Alice"`.

If you use this option and read this line, I would really appreciate it if you let me know the results. Either send me a mail (basjetimmer at yahoo-dot-com) or feel free to just open an issue on the tracker for feedback.

**<span id="desktop">Importing conversations from Signal-Desktop</span>**

_NOTE: This feature is highly experimental, problems may occur. Make sure to always keep a copy of your original backup file. Feedback is appreciated_

_NOTE 2: While this program will compile and work with almost any version of sqlite3, this specific feature requires that the sqlite3 version used is at least as new as the one used by Signal Desktop. Older versions will likely not be able to read Signal Desktop's database. For example, as of writing, the version available in Ubuntu is older than the one used by Signal Desktop. For Ubuntu(-like) distributions a PPA exists with a more up-to-date version [here](https://launchpad.net/~linuxgndu/+archive/ubuntu/sqlitebrowser) (disclaimer: I am not affiliated with this PPA, and never used it)._

To import conversations from a Signal-Desktop installation, run:
```
signalbackup-tools [input] [passphrase] --importfromdesktop --output [output] (--opassphrase [newpassphrase])
```

As with all commands this program supports, `[input]` is an existing Signal Android backup file. The messages from the desktop are imported into this backup file.

Make sure your Signal-Desktop instance is cleanly shut down before running, if this fails for some reason the option `--ignorewal` can be added (the program will warn about this and exit if necessary), but this may cause the database appears in an out-of-date state. `--importfromdesktop` optionally takes two arguments specifying the locations of the `config.json` and `sql/db.sqlite` files respectively. Again, the program will warn and exit if it fails to find them at their default locations (Linux: `~/.config/Signal/`, macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Signal/`, Windows: `C:/Users/<Username>/AppData/Roaming/Signal/`).

To limit the message import to a certain time frame, the option `--limittodates <LIST OF DATES>` can be added. The format of the list of dates is identical to that of the [croptodates function](#crop). If your input backup file is newer than your Signal-Desktop data, the option `--autolimitdates` can be used to automatically only import messages from before the first message in the input backup.

This function has some limitations, most notably the contacts referenced in the data that is to be imported must be present in the Android backup. If a message is found that is sent by/to an unknown contact, it is skipped. For other limitations see [here](https://github.com/bepaald/signalbackup-tools/issues/57#issuecomment-1329475240).

**<span id="deleting_attachments">Deleting/Replacing attachments</span>**

_NOTE: This feature is highly experimental, problems may occur. Make sure to always keep a copy of your original backup file. Feedback is appreciated_

##### Deleting attachments

To remove attachments from the database, while keeping the message bodies (for example to shrink the size of the backup) the option `--deleteattachments` can be used:

```
signalbackup-tools [input] [passphrase] --deleteattachments --output [output] (--opassphrase [newpassphrase])
```

To further specify precisely which attachments are to be deleted, the following options can be added:
- `--onlyinthreads [list-of-threads]`. The list supports commas for single ids and hyphens for ranges, for example: `--onlyinthreads 1,2,5-8,10`. To obtain the number-id of threads use `--listthreads`.
- `--onlyolderthan [date]`/`--onlynewerthan [date]`. Where 'date' supports the same format as the `--croptodates` option ([here](#crop)).
- `--onlylargerthan [size]`. The size is specified in bytes.
- `--onlytype [mime type]`. This argument can be repeated. Only selects attachments which match 'mime type*' (note the asterisk). For example `--onlytype image/j` will match both 'image/jpg' and 'image/jpeg'. To delete all image type attachments, simply use `--onlytype image`.
- `--prependbody [string]`/`--appendbody [string]`. Prepend or append the message body with the supplied string. If the message was otherwise empty, the body will equal the supplied string. Otherwise, it will be appended or prepended and a blank line will be inserted automatically. Suggested use: `--prependbody "(One or more media attachments for this message were deleted)"`.

When adding this specifying options, only attachments which match _all_ given options are deleted.

##### Replacing attachments

There are two ways to replace attachments in a database. Currently attachments can only be replaced with image files of type jpeg, png or gif (non-animated).

###### Option 1

To replace attachments in a backup file one can use the option `--replaceattachments [type=image,type2=image2,...]`. Where '_type_' is a mime type and image is the new attachment. To narrow the selection of attachments being replaced, all the same options mentioned above can be used (`--onlyinthreads`, `--onlyolderthan`, `--onlylargerthan`, `--onlytype`).

Note the mime types do not have to be complete, and the longest type will be matched with highest precedence. In the above case, that means all `image/gif` images are replaced with _"GIF.png"_, while all other images are replaced with _"IMAGE.png"_.

![replace_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38437099/154285515-0ca20937-dab8-436d-a333-7a614060ed37.png)

  </p>

###### Option 2

To more easily replace individual attachments with other files, one can first [export the decrypted backup to a directory](#dump), and then for each attachment to replace, place the new file in the directory and name it exactly like the attachment to be replaced, changing the extension to '_.new_'. Then call the program with the `--replaceattachments` option (without arguments).

If you also need to edit the attachments, dump the backup to directory first ([as described above](#dump)) and do whatever you want, but realize when editing the .bin file, it will usually require changes to also be made to the .sbf file and the sql database to end up with a valid database.


## Future plans

- ~~merging existing backups (successful tests have been done)~~ _DONE_
- exporting to other formats (~~csv~~, xml, ~~html~~) _WIP_
- ~~cropping backup to certain conversations and time spans (successfully done in testing)~~ _DONE_
- ~~replacing/deleting attachments without changing/deleting messages. For example, replacing with thumbnails or tiny placeholders to save space.~~ _DONE (pretty much <sub><sup>hopefully</sup></sub>)_
- ~~importing databases from the desktop app. I have no experience with that yet.~~ _DONE (<sub><sup>I think, mostly</sup></sub>)_

Development will be slow at times.
